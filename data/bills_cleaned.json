    "text": "H.R.2170\nof the\nTo name the Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient\nclinic in Toms River, New Jersey, the Leonard G. 'Bud' Lomell, VA\nClinic, and for other purposes.\nSECTION 1. FINDINGS.\nCongress finds the following:\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic, a\nstate-of-the-art facility serving the region's largest veteran\npopulation, located at 1055 Hooper Avenue, recently opened in the\nTownship of Toms River, Ocean County, New Jersey, in the Fourth\nCongressional District.\nThe local community, including veterans, believe that this\nfacility deserves to be named in honor of Second Lieutenant Leonard\nG. ``Bud'' Lomell, a long time Toms River and Ocean County\nresident, who served courageously and heroically during World War\nII.\nSecond Lieutenant Lomell was born in 1920, the adopted son\nof Scandinavian immigrant parents living in Brooklyn, New York, and\nhis family eventually moved to Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey.\nAfter graduating from Tennessee Wesleyan College, Second\nLieutenant Lomell was drafted into the Army, serving first with the\n76th (Liberty Bell) Infantry Division. When the 2nd Ranger\nBattalion was formed in April 1943, Leonard Lomell was invited to\nbe the First Sergeant of D Company.\nOn D-Day, June 6, 1944, First Sergeant Lomell's platoon\nlanded at Pointe du Hoc, Normandy, France, successfully scaling the\ncliffs, despite a withering German defensive barrage.\nPointe du Hoc, a rugged 100-foot-high coastal promenade\nalong the English Channel was located between the American landing\nbeaches, Omaha and Utah. It was heavily defended by the Germans and\nthe mission of Colonel James Earl Rudder's 225 Rangers was to\ndisable five 155-millimeter artillery guns, which could have rained\nartillery fire on the American forces landing on either beach,\njeopardizing the invasion.\nUnknown to the American forces, the guns had been moved\nfrom the tip of the Pointe and hidden, pointed in the direction of\nUtah Beach, in an inland apple orchard nearly a mile from the\ncoastal batteries.\nFirst Sergeant Lomell and another Ranger, Sergeant Jack\nKuhn, found the guns undefended, and, with Kuhn providing cover,\nLomell destroyed the weapons with thermite grenades and used his\nrifle butt to smash the sights of the guns.\nFirst Sergeant Lomell subsequently received a battlefield\npromotion to Second Lieutenant, and was awarded some of the Army's\nhighest honors, including the Distinguished Service Cross, Purple\nHeart, and Silver Star.\nRenowned historian Steven Ambrose regarded First Sergeant\nLomell's valiant acts along with General Eisenhower's decision to\ninvade on June 6, 1944, as the most significant actions ensuring\nthe Allied victory on D-Day.\nFollowing World War II, Second Lieutenant Lomell was\nappointed as the First Director of the newly organized Ocean County\nVeteran's Service Bureau, serving from 1946 until 1948, before he\nattended law school on the G.I. Bill.\nLeonard Lomell and his wife, Charlotte Ewart Lomell,\nsettled their growing family in Toms River, where, in 1957, Leonard\nestablished his own law firm, which grew to become one of Ocean\nCounty's largest firms.\nLeonard Lomell was involved in numerous local civic,\nbusiness, and charitable organizations, including serving as\npresident of the Ocean County Bar Association, a director of the\nFirst National Bank of Toms River, a member of the Dover Township\nBoard of Education, and a co-founder of the Garden State\nPhilharmonic. He was also National Commander of the Legion of Valor\n(1964-1965) and President of the Ranger Battalion Association of\nWorld War II (1967) and served on the French Committee of Pointe du\nHoc.\nSecond Lieutenant Lomell is profiled in ``The Greatest\nGeneration'', former NBC news Anchor Tom Brokaw's testament to the\nheroes of World War II, and ``Len Lomell: D-Day Hero'', Steven M.\nGillon's entry in the American War Heroes Series.\nAs a decorated war hero, model citizen, and dedicated\nhusband and father, Second Lieutenant Lomell is exceedingly\ndeserving of the posthumous honor of having a new and long-awaited\nToms River-based Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic\nnamed in his honor.\nNAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED\nOUTPATIENT CLINIC, TOMS RIVER, NEW JERSEY.\nThe community-based outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans\nAffairs in Toms River, New Jersey, shall, after the date of the\nenactment of this Act, be known and designated as the ``Leonard G.\n`Bud' Lomell VA Clinic''. Any reference to such clinic in any law,\nregulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States\nshall be considered to be a reference to the Leonard G. ``Bud'' Lomell\nVA Clinic."

Commander Lou Conter, the last remaining survivor of\nthe attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, was an American\nhero.\nOn that fearful day, Petty Officer Conter helped evacuate\nshipmates who were blinded, wounded, or burned, even restraining\nsome of his fellow shipmates from jumping overboard into the\nburning sea.\nIn the days after the attack, he helped with recovering\nbodies and putting out fires. Lou Conter's heroic actions saved the\nlives of many of his shipmates on December 7, 1941.\nFollowing Pearl Harbor, Conter continued serving during\nWWII in New Guinea and in Europe as an enlisted naval aviation\npilot assigned to VP-11, a ``Black Cat'' Squadron.\nLou Conter would be awarded with the Distinguished Flying\nCross for actively taking part in the rescue of 219 Australians\ntrapped by Japanese troops in New Guinea.\nLater, in the Korean War, he served on the USS Bon Homme\nRichard as both an intelligence officer and a navy aviation pilot.\nFollowing his service in the Korean War, he served as a military\nintelligence advisor to three Presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower,\nJohn F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson.\nDuring the 1950s, Lou Conter played a prominent role in the\nestablishment and development of the Navy Survival, Evasion,\nResistance and Escape (SERE) training program.\nIn addition to the Distinguished Flying Cross, he was\nawarded the Navy Commendation Medal and became the first recipient\nof the USS Arizona Medal of Freedom.\nLouis Conter retired from the Navy in 1967 after serving\n28 years as a Lieutenant Commander.\nFollowing his retirement, he generously gave his time to\nshare his personal experiences at veterans' ceremonies and by\ngiving lectures to students.\nLieutenant Commander Conter's lectures were popular with\ngenerations of local students who were equally fascinated and\nenthralled by his first-person accounts.\nHe is eminently deserving of recognition for his decades\nof service to a grateful nation.\nLieutenant Commander Conter passed away in Grass Valley,\nCalifornia on April 1, 2024.\nNAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED\nOUTPATIENT CLINIC, AUBURN, CALIFORNIA.\nThe Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient\nclinic in Auburn, California, shall after the date of the enactment of\nthis Act be known and designated as the ``Louis A.
