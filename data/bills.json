'Bud' Lomell, VA \n                     Clinic, and for other purposes.\n\n    Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the \nUnited States of America in Congress assembled,\nSECTION 1. FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) The Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic, a \n    state-of-the-art facility serving the region's largest veteran \n    population, located at 1055 Hooper Avenue, recently opened in the \n    Township of Toms River, Ocean County, New Jersey, in the Fourth \n    Congressional District.\n        (2) The local community, including veterans, believe that this \n    facility deserves to be named in honor of Second Lieutenant Leonard \n    G. ``Bud'' Lomell, a long time Toms River and Ocean County \n    resident, who served courageously and heroically during World War \n    II.\n        (3) Second Lieutenant Lomell was born in 1920, the adopted son \n    of Scandinavian immigrant parents living in Brooklyn, New York, and \n    his family eventually moved to Point Pleasant Beach, New Jersey.\n        (4) After graduating from Tennessee Wesleyan College, Second \n    Lieutenant Lomell was drafted into the Army, serving first with the \n    76th (Liberty Bell) Infantry Division. When the 2nd Ranger \n    Battalion was formed in April 1943, Leonard Lomell was invited to \n    be the First Sergeant of D Company.\n        (5) On D-Day, June 6, 1944, First Sergeant Lomell's platoon \n    landed at Pointe du Hoc, Normandy, France, successfully scaling the \n    cliffs, despite a withering German defensive barrage.\n        (6) Pointe du Hoc, a rugged 100-foot-high coastal promenade \n    along the English Channel was located between the American landing \n    beaches, Omaha and Utah. It was heavily defended by the Germans and \n    the mission of Colonel James Earl Rudder's 225 Rangers was to \n    disable five 155-millimeter artillery guns, which could have rained \n    artillery fire on the American forces landing on either beach, \n    jeopardizing the invasion.\n        (7) Unknown to the American forces, the guns had been moved \n    from the tip of the Pointe and hidden, pointed in the direction of \n    Utah Beach, in an inland apple orchard nearly a mile from the \n    coastal batteries.\n        (8) First Sergeant Lomell and another Ranger, Sergeant Jack \n    Kuhn, found the guns undefended, and, with Kuhn providing cover, \n    Lomell destroyed the weapons with thermite grenades and used his \n    rifle butt to smash the sights of the guns.\n        (9) First Sergeant Lomell subsequently received a battlefield \n    promotion to Second Lieutenant, and was awarded some of the Army's \n    highest honors, including the Distinguished Service Cross, Purple \n    Heart, and Silver Star.\n        (10) Renowned historian Steven Ambrose regarded First Sergeant \n    Lomell's valiant acts along with General Eisenhower's decision to \n    invade on June 6, 1944, as the most significant actions ensuring \n    the Allied victory on D-Day.\n        (11) Following World War II, Second Lieutenant Lomell was \n    appointed as the First Director of the newly organized Ocean County \n    Veteran's Service Bureau, serving from 1946 until 1948, before he \n    attended law school on the G.I. Bill.\n        (12) Leonard Lomell and his wife, Charlotte Ewart Lomell, \n    settled their growing family in Toms River, where, in 1957, Leonard \n    established his own law firm, which grew to become one of Ocean \n    County's largest firms.\n        (13) Leonard Lomell was involved in numerous local civic, \n    business, and charitable organizations, including serving as \n    president of the Ocean County Bar Association, a director of the \n    First National Bank of Toms River, a member of the Dover Township \n    Board of Education, and a co-founder of the Garden State \n    Philharmonic. He was also National Commander of the Legion of Valor \n    (1964-1965) and President of the Ranger Battalion Association of \n    World War II (1967) and served on the French Committee of Pointe du \n    Hoc.\n        (14) Second Lieutenant Lomell is profiled in ``The Greatest \n    Generation'', former NBC news Anchor Tom Brokaw's testament to the \n    heroes of World War II, and ``Len Lomell: D-Day Hero'', Steven M. \n    Gillon's entry in the American War Heroes Series.\n        (15) As a decorated war hero, model citizen, and dedicated \n    husband and father, Second Lieutenant Lomell is exceedingly \n    deserving of the posthumous honor of having a new and long-awaited \n    Toms River-based Department of Veterans Affairs outpatient clinic \n    named in his honor.\nSEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED \nOUTPATIENT CLINIC, TOMS RIVER, NEW JERSEY.\n    The community-based outpatient clinic of the Department of Veterans \nAffairs in Toms River, New Jersey, shall, after the date of the \nenactment of this Act, be known and designated as the ``Leonard G. \n`Bud' Lomell VA Clinic''. Any reference to such clinic in any law, \nregulation, map, document, record, or other paper of the United States \nshall be considered to be a reference to the Leonard G. ``Bud'' Lomell \nVA Clinic.\n\n                               Speaker of the House of Representatives.\n\n                            Vice President of the United States and    \n                                               President of the Senate."

    and requirements described in subsection (a).\n            (B) Recertifications.--With respect to any recertification \n        certification submitted by a State payment stablecoin regulator \n

      changed from the prior certification or there has been a \n            significant change in circumstances; and\n                (ii) the material change in the regime or significant \n            change in circumstances described in clause (i) is such \n            that the State-level regulatory regime will not promote the \n            safe and sound operation of State qualified payment \n            stablecoin issuers under its supervision.\n            (C) Opportunity to cure.--\n                (i) In general.--With respect to a denial described \n            under subparagraph (A) or (B), the Stablecoin Certification \n            Review Committee shall provide the State payment stablecoin \n            regulator with not less than 180 days from the date on \n            which the State payment stablecoin regulator is notified of \n            such denial to--\n\n                    (I) make such changes as may be necessary to ensure \n                the State-level regulatory regime meets or exceeds the \n                standards described in subsection (a); and\n                    (II) resubmit the initial certification or \n                recertification.\n\n                (ii) Denial.--If, after a State payment stablecoin \n            regulator resubmits an initial certification or \n            recertification under clause (i), the Stablecoin \n            Certification Review Committee again determines that the \n            initial certification or recertification shall result in a \n            denial, the Stablecoin Certification Review Committee \n            shall, not later than 30 days after such determination, \n            provide the State payment stablecoin regulator with a \n            written explanation for the determination.\n            (D) Appeal of denial.--A State payment stablecoin regulator \n        in receipt of a denial under subparagraph (C)(ii) may appeal \n        the denial

\n    within 180 days of the date of enactment of this Act, has in effect \n    a prudential regulatory regime (including regulations and guidance) \n    for the supervision of digital assets or payment stablecoins, the \n    certification process under this paragraph with respect to that \n    regime occurs on an expedited timeline after the effective date of \n    this Act.\n    (d)

FINDINGS.\n    Congress finds the following:\n        (1) Louis ``Lou'' Anthony Conter was born on September 13, \n    1921, in Ojibwa, Wisconsin.\n        (2) Lt. Commander Lou Conter, the last remaining survivor of \n    the attack on the USS Arizona at Pearl Harbor, was an American \n    hero.\n        (3) On that fearful day, Petty Officer Conter helped evacuate \n    shipmates who were blinded, wounded, or burned, even restraining \n    some of his fellow shipmates from jumping overboard into the \n    burning sea.\n        (4) In the days after the attack, he helped with recovering \n    bodies and putting out fires. Lou Conter's heroic actions saved the \n    lives of many of his shipmates on December 7, 1941.\n        (5) Following Pearl Harbor, Conter continued serving during \n    WWII in New Guinea and in Europe as an enlisted naval aviation \n    pilot assigned to VP-11, a ``Black Cat'' Squadron.\n        (6) Lou Conter would be awarded with the Distinguished Flying \n    Cross for actively taking part in the rescue of 219 Australians \n    trapped by Japanese troops in New Guinea.\n        (7) Later, in the Korean War, he served on the USS Bon Homme \n    Richard as both an intelligence officer and a navy aviation pilot. \n    Following his service in the Korean War, he served as a military \n    intelligence advisor to three Presidents: Dwight D. Eisenhower, \n    John F. Kennedy, and Lyndon B. Johnson.\n        (8) During the 1950s, Lou Conter played a prominent role in the \n    establishment and development of the Navy Survival, Evasion, \n    Resistance and Escape (SERE) training program.\n        (9) In addition to the Distinguished Flying Cross, he was \n    awarded the Navy Commendation Medal and became the first recipient \n    of the USS Arizona Medal of Freedom.\n        (10) Louis Conter retired from the Navy in 1967 after serving \n    28 years as a Lieutenant Commander.\n        (11) Following his retirement, he generously gave his time to \n    share his personal experiences at veterans' ceremonies and by \n    giving lectures to students.\n        (12) Lieutenant Commander Conter's lectures were popular with \n    generations of local students who were equally fascinated and \n    enthralled by his first-person accounts.\n        (13) He is eminently deserving of recognition for his decades \n    of service to a grateful nation.\n        (14) Lieutenant Commander Conter passed away in Grass Valley, \n    California on April 1, 2024.\nSEC. 2. NAME OF DEPARTMENT OF VETERANS AFFAIRS COMMUNITY-BASED \nOUTPATIENT CLINIC, AUBURN, CALIFORNIA.\n    The Department of Veterans Affairs community-based outpatient \nclinic in Auburn, California, shall after the date of the enactment of \nthis Act be known and designated as the ``Louis A.
